            <h2>Kihaile, Susie</h2>
            <p>I have had the importance of code organization reinforced on me. Seeing the difference in the presentation and business layers after iterations 1 and 2 was major. The presentation layer code looks much cleaner now that it’s not cluttered with a million if statements and it also makes it a lot easier to read when you just have the name of a function in the business class rather than a bunch of logic code. At the start, I found it quite tedious to have code separated into three different layers because back then we had so many classes and so little code. I’m also just used to plopping my code down somewhere and keeping it organized by making functions but with how big our program is, it’s definitely a lot easier to follow with the organization we learned in class. I still get lost looking for certain classes sometimes so I can’t imagine how much worse it would’ve been if we didn’t have all of our different packages organizing the different kinds of code. 
                I also learned a lot of shortcuts in my IDE programs from interacting with the group.

            <h2>Nguyen, Tung</h2>
            <p>I learned how to structure my codes so that it’s easily understood and better maintained in the future. I also acquired more knowledge about HSQLDB and how different layers communicate with each other. Being able to write codes involving front end to back end allow me to understand the principle of abstraction and separation of concerns. To work collaboratively effectively with my teammate I learned how to use Git which makes the communication and merging less troublesome.</p>

            <h2>Olfert, Luke</h2>
            <p>I learned a variety of things while working on our app. A lot of these were design related. For instance, I learned and saw specific applications of several patterns such as MVVM and Builder. I also learned about a lot about how Android works and the strategies it uses it cope with common problems in UI programming, particularly while working with the Navigation Component API. I gained some experience with layered application architecture as well and came to better understand its benefits. Other things I learned were more related to programming practices. For one thing, I realized the importance of style consistency in things like variable names and class structures and how it can affect the clarity of an application’s code. I also learned about branching strategies and how to use Git in a collaborative context.</p>

            <h2>Sun, Siwen</h2>
            <p>Through this project, I learned how to use Android studio, and learned about the project structure of the Android project, how to use hsqldb, including creating tables, and initializing the database into the emulator. It concatenates what I have learned in university, from the writing of the java language, the design of the product, the human-computer interaction and the use of the database. Especially I learned to use git to manage our codes. This course is a very realistic simulation of post-job development scenarios by completing group tasks, which helps us adapt to the workplace after graduation.</p>

            <h2>Youn, Dani</h2>
            <p>By working on this project, I was able to gain skills for layering code for a better architecture, and how to collaborate with team members in an agile setup. I noticed how smoother our meetings and development were after each iteration and retrospective. On the technical side, I learned how to create Android specific elements using design patterns we learned in class like Adaptors or Builders. Lastly, I was once again reminded the importance of clean coding and proper documentation. It was much easier for us to use interfaces of other members when they had some documentation on it with a clear structure.</p>
